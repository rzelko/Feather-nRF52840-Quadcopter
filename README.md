# Feather-nRF52840-Quadcopter

The FlightControllerLEDs.h and .cpp files are my first attempt at creating a library file.  I have surely overcomplicated my first attempt at creating a library by incorporating and using another library within.  Where I am with this library (and sketch) is that when I burn it to the Feather Sense, it locks up the MCU and I can't access the serial port.  I am not sure what is happening here.
